3. linking local garages design shops customization shops and authorized dealers in parts with people who want to maintain their vehicles in the most convienent , affordable way



### Some Additional points

1. People don't care much about their vehicles apart from the "must do" things is because for the most part its tedious. Just like any other aggregator in any other domain the job of the platform is to make this process convinent and trust worthy so that people realise that they need to take more care about their vehicles
2. Providing Repair and maintenece service will be done through the local garage's present in the vicinty.  local garages will get more traffic this way. 
3. All though the current focus of the business would be to provide essential services like repair and maintence . the one domain which i have most hopes for and the one currently un explored also is the services regarding customization of the vehicles. I m making an assumption that people want to customize their vehicles to their liking but since it is such an un organized sector most people refrain from it.
